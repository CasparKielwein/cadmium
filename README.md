# Cadmium
## Simple Browser Automation in Kotlin

Cadmium is a browser automation librady based on Selenium.
It leverages the power of the Kotlin language to use of Selenium simple and concise

## Why not Selenium directly?
* Selenium-java is somewhat verbose as is often the case in java
* Calling a java library directly in Kotlin causes issues with null safety.
The wrappers provided by Cadmium make it explicit, when `null` is a possibility.  

Cadmium selenide has a beautiful red color.
